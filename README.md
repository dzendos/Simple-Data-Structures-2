# Simple-Data-Structures-2
Implements FibbonacciHeap, Graph, BTree, and SortingAlgorithms

## Folder Structure
Each folder has the same structures â€“ they contain interfaces for classes they represent and their 
implementation, sometime they contain supplementary files needed for data structure representation

algorithms: this folder contains additional algorithms that can be used by data structures

All other folders contain implementations of different Data Structures

## Tests
File checker.cpp checks all the methods of data structures
