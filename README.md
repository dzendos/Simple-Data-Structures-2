## Folder Structure
Each folder has the same structures – they contain interfaces for classes they represent and their 
implementation, sometime they contain supplementary files needed for data structure representation
• algorithms: this folder contains additional algorithms that can be used by data structures

All other folders contain implementations of different Data Structures

## Tests
File checker.cpp checks all the methods of data structures
